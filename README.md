# next-preact-typescript template

A very simple template for starting a project with Next.js + Preact + TypeScript
Based on [using-preact example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/using-preact)

Includes:
- TypeScript
- Prettier
- Eslint

Bring whatever else you want on your own. 

Meant personal usage, but you can use it too, I guess.
